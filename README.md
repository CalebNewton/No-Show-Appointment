# No-Show-Appointment

This dataset collects information from 100000 medical appointments in brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. This dataset was originally sourced from kaggle as NoShowAppointments

## Questions to Solve

* What are the top 5 ages of men that showed up the most for their appointment?
* What's the proportion of male to female who showed up for their appointment?
* What's the relationship between (age and gender), (gender and No_show), (age, gender and No_show)?
* What's the number of males with hypertension that showed up for their appointment?

## Summary of Findings

* Men that were 0-yo, showed up the most for their appointments. They were about 1498
* 80% men showed up for their appointments as against 79.6% women that showed up for their appointments. The % difference amongst gender can be said to be negligible since it's just about 0.4%
* The oldest females were 115yo while the oldest men were 100yo. Hence, it can be seen they were more younger men than women as can be seen from the youngest males and females.
* 57246 females out of 71840 showed up for their appointment while about 30962 males out of 38687 showed up for their appointments.
* 1403 females of 0-yo showed up for their appointment while 1498 males of same age showed up for their appointment. It can be seen the lower the age, the higher their chances of making it to their appointment since less than 12 females of age 98 and above were able to show up while less than 13 males of age 95 and above did same.
* 5347 males with hypertension showed up for their appointment
From the above analysis, it can be seen that age plays a pivotal role in patients showing up for their appointments. The older we become, the less willing we are to make it for appointment. Also, it can be seen that more women suffers from hypertension and diabetes. This may not be accurate since the values of our dataset are hypothetical. Furthermore, I hope to explore real life dataset in future to ascertain these findings and to confirm if my hypothetical testing conforms with it.
